The Abington 10k &amp; Fun Run is a yearly running event organised by [Great Abington Primary School PTFA](http://www.greatabington.school/ptfa/) to raise funds for [Great Abington Primary School](https://Twitter.com/GA_Primary).

The start and finish lines are located in the grounds of Granta Park, easily accessible by road and with plenty of parking.

The 10k route takes you around the picturesque villages of [Little and Great Abington](http://www.theabingtons.org.uk/). Two water stations will be in operation along the route.

The 2k Fun Run is entirely within the grounds of Granta Park, totally traffic free!

Next year's race will be the **12th Abington 10k &amp; Fun Run**.
